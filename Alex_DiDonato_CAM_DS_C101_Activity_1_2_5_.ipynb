        "As you know, **Communik8** has experienced a reduction in both new and existing customers. The Head of Sales has suggested that an analysis of customer behaviour might provide insight into the reason(s) why. To this end, the company has provided you with a list of metrics, or features, from its data to help identify factors influencing customer behaviour. Think about your own experiences as a customer and what factors might influence how, what, and when you purchase something from a vendor. For example:\n",
        "- Customer age\n",
        "- Purchase amount\n",
        "- Location\n",
