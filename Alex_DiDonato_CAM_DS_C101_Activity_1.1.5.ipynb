    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "**Communik8** is a telecommunications company with both online and physical stores. It provides mobile contracts and sells handsets. Recently, the company has experienced a sizeable reduction in new customers and a decrease in the retention of existing customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the primary goal of improving business performance, the company needs to identify critical reasons for this recent decline. The company would like to make sense of its customer data and transform it into actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The management team at Communik8 has provided recent customer feedback to your team of data scientists and would like initial feedback on the main issues that can be identified from this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal is to explore and analyse an organisational scenario to identify key problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment criteria\n",
    "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
    "* Note common themes and sentiments expressed by customers without performing any in-depth analysis.\n",
    "* Formulate your own business problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activity guide\n",
    "1. Analyse the customer comments and categorise the comments into themes (e.g.  customer service, delivery, billing and payment, and so on).\n",
    "2. Using the themes you identified as guidance, define the problems Communik8's customers are experiencing (e.g. delays in delivery, website functionality, and so on).\n",
    "3. Identify how solving these problems will help the company achieve its objectives and goals and outline the consequences of not achieving these goals (e.g. improved customer satisfaction, customer retention, loss of revenue, and so on).\n",
    "4. Write a problem statement based on the themes, problems, and solutions you identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What challenges did you face when completing this activity?\n",
    "* In one sentence, what was your key learning from this activity?"

    "The company is facing a decline in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Long call wait times, delayed deliveries, poor network reliability, inconsistent in-store service, and unresponsive online support are reducing customer satisfaction and trust. Additionally, billing inaccuracies, failed cancellations, and insufficient staff training have compounded the problem, leading to increased complaints and operational strain. This is leading to, cancelled contracts, and lost revenue, increased support costs, and unecessary operation overhead (customer support, rectifying mistakes and incorrect revenue protection actions) and damage to the brand’s reputation which will ultimately lead to fewer sales and reduced revenue. Existing customers are losing confidence in both digital and in-store channels, which will lead to higher customer churn.\n",
