        "## Scenario\n",
        "Developing and testing hypotheses help to address organisational challenges and problems not only with data but also in broader organisational contexts. Building on the problem statement from the previous activity in Week 1, define a hypothesis and propose a solution related to customer satisfaction factors and their impact on business performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables and be framed in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. The hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to work formulate a hypothesis, identify cause-and-effect relationship, and create an if–then statement with a possible solution approach.\n",

        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "- Formulate your own hypothesis.\n",
        "- Identify a cause-and-effect relationship between variables.\n",

The hypothesis must clearly state the relationship between variables and be framed in a way that allows for data collection and analysis. The hypothesis should be specific and testable. For example, the hypothesis that ‘an increase in dropped calls and network disruptions leads to higher customer churn rates (reduced customer retention)’ is specific and can be tested by correlating network performance data with churn rates over time.\n",
        "3. Create an if-then statement to suggest a possible solution approach. For example, **if** the analysis confirms a significant correlation between increased wait times for customer service calls and higher customer churn rates, **then** the company should focus on improving efficiency and responsiveness in its customer service operations.\n",

        "The company is facing a decline in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Long call wait times, delayed deliveries, poor network reliability, inconsistent in-store service, and unresponsive online support are reducing customer satisfaction and trust. Additionally, billing inaccuracies, failed cancellations, and insufficient staff training have compounded the problem, leading to increased complaints and operational strain. This is leading to, cancelled contracts, and lost revenue, increased support costs, and unecessary operation overhead (customer support, rectifying mistakes and incorrect revenue protection actions) and damage to the brand’s reputation which will ultimately lead to fewer sales and reduced revenue. Existing customers are losing confidence in both digital and in-store channels, which will lead to higher customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "The company needs to identify the root causes of customer dissatisfaction resulting from, delivery inefficiencies, process failures, network reliability and decline in customer service in the form of, a poor online / digital experience, long call wait times and unhelpful customer service staff. The company should implement targeted strategies for improvement, to strengthen these areas.\n",

        "An increase in the number of Customers sucessfully using online resources, FAQs, and online chat to answer common customer queries, and / or log support requests, will result in fall in demand for customer support calls leading to shorter call queues and wait times. Conversly a poor customer experience when accessing online resources will result in a greater volume of customers resorting to contacting customer support directly by phone, where they will experience higher wait times due to the higher volume of calls. If we analyse customer use of the available online support resources and determine a success metric from this (e.g. an interaction would be deemed unsucessful if a customer engaged in online chat and subsequently abandoned the interaction), and compare this with call queue volumes and wait times, we can identify opportunities to reduce call volumes.\n",

        "(2) If analysis confirms that customers who successfully use online support resources (such as FAQs, self-service tools, and chat) experience fewer needs to contact the call centre, resulting in reduced call volumes and shorter wait times, then enhancing the effectiveness of online support will directly reduce demand on customer support, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall operational efficiency.\n",
