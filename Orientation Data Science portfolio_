For example, separate data loading, data cleaning, data visualisation, and model training.\n","*   Use text cells (Markdown) to explain your decisions, rationale, and findings and to write down important information.\n","*   Use descriptive names in lower case, and separate words with underscores (e.g. data_clean) when naming variables and functions. For constants, use upper case with underscores (e.g. TAX_RATE). Avoid single-letter names unless in a local context (e.g. loop indices).\n","*   Use four spaces per indentation level, and limit all lines to 80 characters.\n","*   Group your imports at the beginning of the file. Follow the order: standard libraries, third-party libraries, and local modules.\n","*   To clarify the code, you can insert comments. However, inline comments should be used sparingly and only used where relevant. Use docstrings to describe the purpose, parameters, and return value.\n","\n","**Data science best practices**:\n","*   **Reproducibility:** Ensure your code can be run from top to bottom without errors in a fresh environment. Use random seeds where randomness is involved.\n","*   **Data management:** Use Pandas or other suitable libraries for data manipulation. Always inspect your data before performing operations.\n","*  **Visualisations:** Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisations. Always provide labels for axes, legends, and a title for all plots.\n","*   **Dependencies:** If using any non-standard libraries, document them. In Google Colab, you can use !pip freeze to list all installed packages.\n","*  **Python style guide:** Ensure you are familiar with the PEP 8 – [Style Guide for Python Code.](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RehI4aW4A5d_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_4cByGDJCmfM"},"source":["## More resources\n","\n","### Working with notebooks in Colab\n","\n","- [Overview of Colaboratory](/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)\n","- [Guide to markdown](/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)\n","- [Importing libraries and installing dependencies](/notebooks/snippets/importing_libraries.ipynb)\n","- [Saving and loading notebooks in GitHub](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/main/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)\n","\n","### Working with data\n","- [Loading data: Drive, Sheets and Google Cloud Storage](/notebooks/io.ipynb)\n","- [Charts: visualising data](/notebooks/charts.ipynb)\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1bAE7vviDHiU1bQipsB5hFvF-IyCiPMdd","timestamp":1761912709470},{"file_id":"/v2/external/notebooks/intro.ipynb","timestamp":1698391990501}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
